# Jupyter Notebooks

This repository includes a variety of jupyter notebooks that I have developed as part of work or personal projects.
Work projects' data has been anonymized to mask origins and protect privacy. 

## Data Analysis Reference
This notebook is used as a quick reference for common data analysis tasks I employ on a regular basis.

## Balloon Grading Rev 4
This notebook is used as part of the grading process at [Project Loon](https://loon.com/) to measure the airworthiness of a balloon based on available manufacturing data.
The notebook helps the user to analyze the manufacturing data of many balloons in order to assign a rating that will classify the balloon as either
airworthy, experimental, or not airworthy at all. By analyzing and assigning these grades to these balloons before they are launched we can prevent 
early bursts as well as balloons with a theoretical short lifespan from going up. Why do we need the balloons to stay up as long as possible?
Well, each balloon has a high price tag so we want to save the company money by encouraging the manufacturer to build balloon to our standards. Also the price tag of a balloon pales in comparison to the electronics and equipment that are being carried by the balloon itself. In case you don't know, the balloon acts as a mobile cell tower in order to bring internet to hard-to-reach areas. Also bear in mind that the recovery costs of an early burst as well as the total loss of that equipment if it were to burst over the ocean also add up significantly in contrast to being able to land the balloon at a specific location where it is easier to recover.
